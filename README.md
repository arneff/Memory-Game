## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## How it works

When the game is opended, a new set of cards is dealt to the enduser. Once the user selects a card, a timer is started keeping track of gameplay time, and a counter is started keeping track of the number of moves the user had made. The goal is to match each card with is pair in as little time and moves as possible. The users raiting will decrease the more moves that are made. Once the game is over, the user has the option to play again which will start the entire game over or 'cancel' which will do nothing until the user chooses to play again.
